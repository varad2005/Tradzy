## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup (Required for full functionality)

Your frontend is static, but features like login, cart, orders need a backend API.

### Option 1: Deploy Flask Backend Separately

**Popular platforms:**
- **Heroku** (Free tier available): https://www.heroku.com/
- **Railway** (Easy setup): https://railway.app/
- **Render** (Free tier): https://render.com/
- **PythonAnywhere** (Python hosting): https://www.pythonanywhere.com/

**After deploying backend:**
1. Get your backend URL (e.g., `https://tradzy-api.herokuapp.com`)
2. Update `frontend/static/api.js`:
   ```javascript
   const BASE_URL = 'https://tradzy-api.herokuapp.com/api';
   ```
3. Redeploy frontend to Netlify

### Option 2: Use Netlify Functions (Serverless)

Convert your Flask routes to Netlify Functions:
- Create `.netlify/functions/` folder
- Write JavaScript/TypeScript functions
- Update `api.js` to use `/.netlify/functions/endpoint`

---

## üîí Enable CORS on Backend

Your Flask backend needs to accept requests from Netlify:

```python
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)

# Allow requests from your Netlify site
CORS(app, origins=[
    'https://your-site.netlify.app',
    'http://localhost:8000'  # for local testing
])
```

---

## üì± Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Domain settings
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. SSL certificate auto-generated!

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### CSS not loading?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify paths are `static/style.css` not `/static/style.css`

### Links not working?
- All links should be `page.html` not `/page`
- Check `_redirects` file exists in frontend folder

### API calls failing?
- Update `BASE_URL` in `static/api.js`
- Check CORS is enabled on backend
- Verify backend is running and accessible
